I want something that fits on my GPU using full-precision and that doesn't require LoRA finetuning. I just think it's simpler given the time constraints.

So I'm curious to look at frontier small VLMs like:
- Qwen2VL (2B) [Link](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2-VL-2B-Instruct)
- SmolVLM (2B) [Link](https://huggingface.co/HuggingFaceTB/SmolVLM-Instruct), [Blog](https://huggingface.co/blog/smolvlm)
- PaliGemma (3B) [Link](https://huggingface.co/google/paligemma-3b-pt-224)

Confirmed: Qwen2VL can process multiple images in a single input.

Idea: Finetune the Adapter and the LLM components, not the ViT.
(Idea)
- The base vision encoder is already good at identifying objects and scenes
- Idiomatic understanding happens at the connection and interpretation layers
- The adapter layers are crucial for connecting visual concepts to linguistic meanings
- This is where the "bridge" between learning visual content and figurative meaning happens

"The idiomatic understanding happens in how visual features are mapped to language (adapter) and how those mappings are interpreted (LLM)"
