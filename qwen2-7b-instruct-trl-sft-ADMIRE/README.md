# Model Card for Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct-finetune-2024-12-04_02-08-26

This model is a fine-tuned version of [Qwen/Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct).
It has been trained using [TRL](https://github.com/huggingface/trl).

## Quick start

```python
from transformers import pipeline

question = "If you had a time machine, but could only go to the past or the future once and never return, which would you choose and why?"
generator = pipeline("text-generation", model="UCSC-Admire/Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct-finetune-2024-12-04_02-08-26", device="cuda")
output = generator([{"role": "user", "content": question}], max_new_tokens=128, return_full_text=False)[0]
print(output["generated_text"])
```
